And I&amp;rsquo;m no different—my favorite pose is on the tummy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo;, it is ideal for both near and distant shots&amp;hellip; Parents frequently decide to print pictures of their baby in this pose.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even though it seems natural, it is difficult to place the baby in this pose. Interfering factors include hypertonia, colic, and a photographer&amp;rsquo;s lack of expertise.
But I always succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the elbow and bent knee contact, it is extremely cool.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, newborn photography demands the extreme care and tenderness and does not accept fanaticism. As a result, if the baby from my third effort does not fit into pose &amp;ldquo;per the book,&amp;rdquo; I will not insist and will instead search for a solution that works for both of us. The &amp;ldquo;on the tummy&amp;rdquo; pose is very lovely no matter how you look at it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not really better, because by refusing to take a photo of a newborn, you are missing the opportunity to capture the important moments of your baby&amp;rsquo;s first days, which are truly worthy of your family photo album. The newborn looks so touching and tender right now. In a few months he/she will be completely different.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Long and deep sleep is a real gift for a newborn photographer. With a sleeping baby, we can bring to life all photo ideas. But what to do when the baby is awake? In my practice, there were no babies who were awake throughout the entire newborn photo shoot. Although I always recommend setting aside enough time for photo shoot - about 2-3 hours and not planning important things (for example, going to the doctor) for the afternoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./newborn-photosession-2.jpg" alt="newborn photography">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="are-poses-safe-for-the-baby">Are poses safe for the baby?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, the poses taken by an experienced newborn photographer are safe for the baby. They do not cause him any inconvenience - the baby continues to sleep peacefully and sweetly. When choosing a newborn photographer, make sure that he has the necessary qualifications. To do this, you can ask the photographer or see on the website what training courses he took in newborn photography.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="newborn-photoshoot-usually-takes-place-in-the-studio-is-it-clean-enough">Newborn photoshoot usually takes place in the studio. Is it clean enough?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, in photo studios intended for newbornphoto shoots, they monitor the cleanliness. Everything you need for shooting is in the studio. Here, a comfortable temperature for the baby is maintained, the props are regularly processed with products safe for newborns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./newborn-photosession-4.jpg" alt="newborn session">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the first photo shoot in your baby&amp;rsquo;s life, because every moment is worth capturing! ❤️&lt;/p>
