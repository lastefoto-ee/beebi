It&amp;rsquo;s a unique time that is filled with emotion, and the photographs that are taken during this time can serve as a lasting tribute to the incredible journey of pregnancy and early parenthood.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Maternity photo shoot in the studio of Tallinn
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Here are some tips for creating a cohesive maternity and newborn photography experience:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Choose the right photographer: It&amp;rsquo;s important to choose a photographer who has experience with both maternity and newborn photography and a portfolio that showcases their skills. Look for someone who has a warm and compassionate demeanor and who is able to capture the beauty and emotion of pregnancy and early parenthood.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Plan ahead: Maternity photography sessions are typically held between the seventh and eighth month of pregnancy, while newborn photography sessions are typically held within the first few weeks of a baby&amp;rsquo;s life. It&amp;rsquo;s important to book your sessions as early as possible to ensure that you have a spot on the photographer&amp;rsquo;s schedule.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Coordinate your outfits: When planning your maternity and newborn photography sessions, consider coordinating your outfits to create a cohesive look for your photographs. This might include choosing similar colors or styles for your clothing or accessories.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Choose a consistent location: The location of your maternity photography sessions can play a big role in the overall look and feel of the photographs. Consider choosing a location that has personal meaning to you, such as the place where you and your partner first met, or a beautiful park or beach.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Incorporate props with sentimental value: Adding props with sentimental value to your maternity and newborn photographs can make them even more special and meaningful. This might include a family heirloom, a special toy, or a sentimental piece of jewelry.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Focus on emotion: Maternity and newborn photography are about capturing the beauty and emotion of this special time in your life. Allow your emotions to show through in your expressions and body language, and focus on capturing candid moments that show the true joy and excitement of pregnancy and early parenthood.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a cohesive album: When selecting your final photographs, consider creating a cohesive album that tells the story of your maternity and newborn photography experience. This might include a combination of posed and candid shots, as well as images that show the progression of your pregnancy and the arrival of your newborn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

And I&amp;rsquo;m no different—my favorite pose is on the tummy.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-session-in-tallinn">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./newborn-photo-shoot-universal-pose-1.jpg" alt="Newborn session in Tallinn" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Insanely touching, with a touching deflection in the back and legs folded in a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo;, it is ideal for both near and distant shots&amp;hellip; Parents frequently decide to print pictures of their baby in this pose.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Even though it seems natural, it is difficult to place the baby in this pose. Interfering factors include hypertonia, colic, and a photographer&amp;rsquo;s lack of expertise.
But I always succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the elbow and bent knee contact, it is extremely cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-newborn-photo-session-in-the-studio">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, newborn photography demands the extreme care and tenderness and does not accept fanaticism. As a result, if the baby from my third effort does not fit into pose &amp;ldquo;per the book,&amp;rdquo; I will not insist and will instead search for a solution that works for both of us. The &amp;ldquo;on the tummy&amp;rdquo; pose is very lovely no matter how you look at it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not really better, because by refusing to take a photo of a newborn, you are missing the opportunity to capture the important moments of your baby&amp;rsquo;s first days, which are truly worthy of your family photo album. The newborn looks so touching and tender right now. In a few months he/she will be completely different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./newborn-photosession-1.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-take-a-photo-of-a-newborn-if-he-only-eats-and-sleeps">How to take a photo of a newborn if he only eats and sleeps?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Long and deep sleep is a real gift for a newborn photographer. With a sleeping baby, we can bring to life all photo ideas. But what to do when the baby is awake? In my practice, there were no babies who were awake throughout the entire newborn photo shoot. Although I always recommend setting aside enough time for photo shoot - about 2-3 hours and not planning important things (for example, going to the doctor) for the afternoon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./newborn-photosession-2.jpg" alt="newborn photography">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="are-poses-safe-for-the-baby">Are poses safe for the baby?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, the poses taken by an experienced newborn photographer are safe for the baby. They do not cause him any inconvenience - the baby continues to sleep peacefully and sweetly. When choosing a newborn photographer, make sure that he has the necessary qualifications. To do this, you can ask the photographer or see on the website what training courses he took in newborn photography.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./newborn-photosession-3.jpg" alt="newborn photo shoot in Tallinn">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="newborn-photoshoot-usually-takes-place-in-the-studio-is-it-clean-enough">Newborn photoshoot usually takes place in the studio. Is it clean enough?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, in photo studios intended for newbornphoto shoots, they monitor the cleanliness. Everything you need for shooting is in the studio. Here, a comfortable temperature for the baby is maintained, the props are regularly processed with products safe for newborns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="./newborn-photosession-4.jpg" alt="newborn session">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the first photo shoot in your baby&amp;rsquo;s life, because every moment is worth capturing! ❤️&lt;/p>
